Before we start, let's understand what `<Refine/>` component is.

The `<Refine/>` is the initialization point of **refine**. It is a wrapper component that provides the context to the **refine** components and hooks. It is used to configure the highest level settings of the app.

In order to initialize the app, the `dataProvider` is the only required prop to be provided. Additionally, it also has other props such as `resources`, `routerProvider`, `authProvider`, `i18nProvider` etc. These props allow for the configuration of different aspects of the app, including data management, routing, authentication, localization, layout etc.

[Refer to the `<Refine/>` documentation for more information &#8594](/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/)

In the context of a CRUD application, a resource typically refers to a data entity that can be created, read, updated, or deleted. For example, a resource could be a user account, a blog post, a product in an online store, or any other piece of data that can be managed by the CRUD app.

To add a `resource` to our app, we need use `resources` prop of `<Refine/>` component. This prop accepts an array of objects. Each object represents a resource. The resource object may contain properties to define the name of the resource, the routes of the actions it can perform which can be defined as paths, components or both and additional metadata such as the label, the icon, audit log settings, nesting etc.

Here's a simple example of how to add a resource to a **refine** app:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
            dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
            //highlight-start
            resources={[
                {
                    name: "products",
                    list: "/products",
                    show: "/products/show/:id",
                    create: "/products/create",
                    edit: "/products/edit/:id",
                },
            ]}
            //highlight-end
        >
            {/* ... */}
        </Refine>
    );
};

export default App;
```

## Defining Actions for a Resource

A resource can perform actions such as `list`, `show`, `edit`, `create`, `delete` and `clone`. These actions except `delete`, are defined in the properties of the resource object. These definitions can be done in multiple ways.

### Using Paths (Recommended)

The simplest way to define the actions is to provide the path of the page. For example, if we want to define the `list` action of the `products` resource, we can do it as follows:

```tsx
{
    name: "products",
    list: "/products",
}
```

Paths are instructing **refine** to acknowledge the existence of the action for a resource at the specified path. This will allow **refine** to infer the resource by the current path without requiring the user to explicitly define the resource in its hooks and components.

Paths can include parameters with a convention similar `:paramName`. For example, if we want to define the `show` action of the `products` resource, we can do it as follows:

```tsx
{
    name: "products",
    show: "/products/show/:id",
}
```

Additional parameters can also be defined in the path. For example, if we want to define the `edit` action of the `products` resource, we can do it as follows:

```tsx
{
    name: "products",
    edit: "/products/edit/:id/:version",
}
```

These additional parameters except for the `id` parameter, can be passed to the components or hooks using `meta` properties. Also the existing parameters in the URL will be used by default when handling the navigation. So, let's say we have a `create` action for the `products` resource as `/:userId/products/create` and the user is currently on the `/:userId/products` page. When the user clicks on the `create` button, the user will be redirected to `/:userId/products/create` page. The `userId` parameter will be inferred from the current path unless it is explicitly defined in the `meta` property.

### Using Components

In addition to paths, we can also define the actions using components. These components can later be rendered through the complementary components from the router packages such as `RefineRoutes`. In this case, **refine** will assign default routes to actions like following:

-   `list` - `/resourceName`
-   `show` - `/resourceName/show/:id`
-   `create` - `/resourceName/create`
-   `edit` - `/resourceName/edit/:id`
-   `clone` - `/resourceName/clone/:id`

For example, if we want to define the `list` action of the `products` resource, we can do it as follows:

```tsx
{
    name: "products",
    list: ProductList,
}
```

### Using Both Paths and Components

We can also define the actions using both paths and components. In this case, the path will be used to render the component by the `RefineRoutes` component, which can be imported from router packages. For example, if we want to define the `show` action of the `products` resource, we can do it as follows:

```tsx
{
    name: "products",
    show: {
        path: "/products/show/:id",
        component: ProductShow,
    }
}
```

:::tip

Features related to routing such as the inference of the resource by the route, the generation of the routes (optional) and etc. require the use of the `routerProvider` prop of the `<Refine/>` component.

[Refer to the documentation for more information &#8594](/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/#routerprovider)

When using the **refine** hooks and components, if you provide a `routerProvider` the `resource` will be inferred from the current route and the inferred resource will be passed as `resource` to `dataProvider` functions, hooks and components by default.
