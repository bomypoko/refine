:::caution Deprecated
This hook is deprecated and only works properly with the legacy routing system. Please use `useResource` instead. Route based matching is now done by the router provider and the `useResource` hook.
:::

`useResourceWithRoute` is used to get the resource object in resources array that you defined in `<Refine>` by route name.

The hook is used internal in **refine**. Normally you don't need this hook, but we export it as it may be useful for some use-cases.

```ts
import { useResourceWithRoute } from "@pankod/refine-core";

const resourceWithRoute = useResourceWithRoute();

const resource = resourceWithRoute("posts");
```
